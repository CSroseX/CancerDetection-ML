# CancerDetection-ML

Welcome to CancerDetection-ML, where we harness the power of machine learning to detect cancer using advanced image analysis techniques. This project serves as a practical exploration of applying pretrained models in the field of medical imaging and machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes PyTorch and torchvision libraries to implement a deep learning model for cancer detection. By leveraging a pretrained ResNet34 model, we demonstrate the practical application of transfer learning in healthcare. The dataset consists of medical images processed using techniques like data augmentation (random horizontal flipping, rotation, and color jittering) to enhance model robustness.

## Strengths

- **Modular Code Structure**: The project is organized into clear sections, making it easy to follow and understand.
- **Custom Dataset Class**: Implemented a `cancer_dataset` class for efficient data loading and preprocessing.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilized techniques like random flips, rotations, and color adjustments to improve model generalization.

## Weaknesses and Improvement Suggestions

- **Model Selection**: Consider experimenting with different architectures (e.g., ResNet50, InceptionV3) for potentially better performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune parameters for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model not only on the test set but also on the validation set to monitor overfitting.
- **Loss Function and Optimizer**: Explore different loss functions and optimizers to optimize model training.

## Additional Suggestions

- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune the pretrained model further on the cancer detection dataset for improved accuracy.
- **Different Architectures**: Experiment with various CNN architectures to find the most suitable one for this specific task.
- **Data Collection**: Increase the size of the dataset to enhance model performance and generalization.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implement ensemble techniques to combine predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy.
